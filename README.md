## New Theory For Neural Mapping
Applying cryptographic reasoning to constructing Neuronet number mapping.

~~~Dataset1
0 Charlotte Dies          0 Never Dates Player
1 Charlotte Fate Unknown  1 Relationship Uknown
2 Charlotte Lives         2 Dates Player
~~~

~~~Dataset2
0 Albert Dies        0 Never Dates Player
1 Albert Fate Uknown 1 Relationship Uknown
2 Albert Lives       2 Dates Player
~~~

~~~
  0 1 2    0 1 2
0        0
1        1
2        2
~~~

Thus the rows for both datasets are:

~~~
0,0 0,1 0,2
1,0 1,1 1,2
2,0 2,1 2,2
~~~

The machine knows 0,0 and 2,2. So it must uncover 14 outcomes.
