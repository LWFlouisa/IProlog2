Thus the rows for both datasets are:

~~~
0,0 0,1 0,2
1,0 1,1 1,2
2,0 2,1 2,2

The machine knows 0,0 and 2,2. So it must uncover 14 outcomes.

## How Phind Interprets My Theory

Based on the provided search results, it seems that you are interested in using the thought process behind the Bifid or Four Square ciphers to uncover hidden information and reveal new endings and story branches in your project. The Bifid cipher is an encryption technique that combines the Polybius square with transposition and uses fractionation to achieve diffusion. It was invented by Felix Delastelle around 1901 [Source 7].

While the Bifid cipher is primarily used for encryption and cryptography, you are exploring its application to uncover hidden information in your project. By leveraging the principles behind the Bifid cipher, such as using coordinates and mixing them to generate new coordinates, you aim to create a variant that enables limited hallucination across unrelated datasets to predict things not originally anticipated [Source 6].

In the context of your project, it appears that you want to use the Bifid cipher's thought process as a mechanism to generate new endings and story branches. By applying the principles of the Bifid cipher, you can potentially uncover hidden connections or patterns within your data that lead to unexpected outcomes in your story. This approach adds an element of surprise and unpredictability to the narrative, making it more engaging for the players.

To implement this approach, you can adapt the Bifid cipher's principles to your specific use case. For example, you can define a mapping scheme that assigns certain coordinates or values to different story elements or events. As the player progresses through the game, you can use the Bifid-inspired mapping to determine which hidden information or connections are revealed, leading to new endings or story branches.

It's important to note that this application of the Bifid cipher's thought process is a creative adaptation of the original cryptographic technique. The Bifid cipher itself is primarily used for encryption and has been extensively studied and analyzed in the field of cryptography. However, your approach takes inspiration from its principles to create a unique storytelling mechanism in your project.

As your project is specific to your use case, it will require careful implementation and experimentation to ensure that the generated story branches and endings align with your narrative goals. Consider how the Bifid-inspired mapping can be integrated into your game's logic and decision-making processes to create a cohesive and immersive experience for the players.

Please note that without more specific details about your project and its implementation, it is challenging to provide a more tailored answer. If you can provide additional context or clarify any specific requirements or challenges you are facing, I would be able to provide more specific guidance.
